At first, _Future of coach_ was only about the vision of Younited personal budget feature. During the couple of weeks needed for this project though, the scope increased tremedously.

It was always the goal to make extensive use of modern gen AI features, but we went beyond that and made a complete new app, made from the ground up for banking features, loans (our core business), and budgetisation.

After an initial brief and brainstorming from the CPO, I had to Imagine, priorize and design three personas and their experience with a totally revamped Younited Coach experience, during 12 intense days. The project wasn't really supposed to be this big, but I saw it as an opportunity to materialize some ideas and concepts I imagined during my previous work at Bankin', plus a healthy dose of modern AI interactions.
