For product design interviews, some companies ask potential recruits to make an in-depth presentation of their work, featuring flows, challenges, results, and anything that can showcase their design skills, problem-solving capabilities, processes, and overall impact.

In this fashion, I made a [long presentation](https://www.figma.com/deck/J9Qks2nSZXkRQx33OzOVio/Projects-Deep-Dive?node-id=1-42&t=E1uvLrL6ZKA0nZFp-1) (over 60 slides now) showcasing 4 projects that I thought were interesting.

Although I think I prefer doing design tests, which allow you to showcase your design capabilities on the spot and without external interference, this is probably a better test of your overall design capabilities within a team.

Anyway, I had a good time making it. If you would rather have me explain my projects instead of your going through all those slides, don't hesitate to reach out!
