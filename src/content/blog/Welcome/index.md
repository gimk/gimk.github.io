On May 20th, during a stroll in Shinjuku during my last week in Japan, I stumbled upon an incredible camera store named _Kitamura Camera_. Seven floors were fully dedicated to cameras and lenses, both new and used.
There, I found a used, cheap, compact 45-175mm telephoto lens for my Micro 4/3 camera.

The next day, I naturally had to take that lens and my small camera for a tour in Tokyo. I went to Ginza and the Tokyo Tower. Here is a sample, but you can find more on my [unsplash profile](https://unsplash.com/@gimmick).
