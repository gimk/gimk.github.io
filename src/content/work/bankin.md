Solo Product Designer at Bankin' (6 million users, Top 1 grossing app in finance at the time of writing)

Shipped 20+ projects in two years, including a complete app redesign and key features like Stories and in-app loans. Collaborated with PMs throughout the product lifecycle, from discovery to delivery and performance analysis. Led design reviews, leveraging my engineering background and former experience as an Android developer. Owned the app's end-to-end user experience with full autonomy on UI/UX decisions. Created interactive prototypes and participated in user testing. Developed and maintained a comprehensive design system.

A clear and simple user experience is the reason I do this work and I'll challenge product decisions as much as i can to reach that goal.
