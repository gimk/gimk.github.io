I closely collaborated with a dedicated team of 10 developers, prioritizing and implementing the features I conceptualized and designed.
Being the sole team member with a design background, I took responsibility for all graphical elements and UX decisions. Additionally, my role involved actively managing and resolving various day-to-day issues, requiring decision-making and occasional management tasks.
